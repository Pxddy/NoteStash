This project is just a simple playground to play around with some topics related to Android development like: 
- Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM) architecture
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Dagger hilt
- Android Navigation Component
- Room
- Android Paging library v3 (I know it's kinda overkill for this app, but I wanted to try it out)
- DataStore
- Material Design 3
- Android Espresso Ui tests
- Junit5
- CI with Github Actions
